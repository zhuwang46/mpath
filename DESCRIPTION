Description: Algorithms optimize penalized models. Currently the models include penalized Poisson, negative binomial, zero-inflated Poisson, zero-inflated negative binomial regression models and robust models. The penalties include least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD), minimax concave penalty (MCP), and each possibly combining with L_2 penalty. The package also contains robust (penalized) generalized linear models and robust support vector machines. See Wang et al. (2014) <doi:10.1002/sim.6314>,
